                "content": "<h2>Purpose and Course of Tax Control</h2><p>The general course of tax control is regulated in § 44 to § 47 of Act No. 563/2009 Coll. on Tax Administration (Tax Code) and on amendments to certain laws (hereinafter \"Tax Code\"). The purpose of tax control is to examine taxpayer procedures in setting transfer prices, i.e., whether they chose an appropriate transfer method, have sufficient documentation for verified transactions, can transparently provide explanations for individual cases, chose the correct basis for comparability analysis, and can adequately demonstrate the application of the arm's length principle in related party transactions carried out in the given tax period.</p><h3>Start and Notification of Tax Control</h3><p>According to § 44 of the Tax Code, tax control begins on the day determined by the tax administrator and about which they inform the taxpayer through notification. The notification must also contain the place of control, type of tax subject to control, controlled period, and deadline for submission of required documentation along with instructions on consequences of non-compliance. The tax administrator may start tax control without notification if they suspect the taxpayer will alter or destroy documents necessary for case assessment.</p><p>If the tax administrator, during ongoing tax control, identifies discrepancies in periods other than those mentioned in the notification, they are entitled to extend the control to these periods as well.</p><h3>Taxpayer Obligations During Control</h3><p>The taxpayer is obliged to allow the tax administrator to perform control, provide access to premises and software, provide cooperation, and lend materials even outside their premises if requested by the tax administrator.</p><p>During control, the tax administrator examines submitted documents for correctness, completeness, and truthfulness. If any discrepancies are identified, they notify the taxpayer and request explanation. The taxpayer may submit all documents and provide evidence and explanations for the case, which the tax administrator then evaluates. If documents or explanations are insufficient, they request supplementation.</p><h2>Most Frequently Controlled Areas</h2><p>From the perspective of controlled areas, the most frequent subject of controls is the area of services, goods, and intangible assets. Additionally, cost allocation between related enterprises and group financing are commonly examined.</p><p>The control itself is conducted through samples selected by the tax administrator, who then requests their submission from the taxpayer. The reason for selecting a particular controlled transaction sample may be its frequency within the taxpayer's overall activity. Sample selection may also be influenced by tax administrator suspicions, for example, if the taxpayer changes business model or switches from profit to loss year-over-year. Tax administrators also typically open tax controls for problematic taxpayers, such as those previously assessed or those conducting risky transactions.</p><h3>What Tax Administrators Control</h3><p>During tax control, tax administrators examine primarily:</p><ul><li>whether the subject of performance was actually delivered or services provided,</li><li>whether the company actually needed the given subject of performance or provided services, i.e., the tax administrator questions whether the controlled entity would provide such service to an independent party,</li><li>whether prices were set in accordance with the arm's length principle.</li></ul><h2>Most Frequently Identified Problems</h2><p>The most frequently identified problems during tax controls include:</p><ul><li><strong>inability of the enterprise to adequately explain services provided between related parties;</strong> the taxpayer must undoubtedly prove that the provided service was justified, i.e., relates to the recipient's needs and complies with the arm's length principle,</li><li><strong>insufficient or non-existent transfer documentation,</strong></li><li><strong>poor quality of transfer documentation,</strong></li><li><strong>inconsistency between documentation content and the taxpayer's business activity and explanations,</strong></li><li><strong>insufficient substantiation of comparability factors,</strong> i.e., inadequate functional and risk analysis, for example, too small or inappropriately chosen comparative base,</li><li><strong>insufficient explanation of lower profit compared to other enterprises in the group,</strong></li><li><strong>non-existence of contracts and other documents that would support the chosen taxpayer approach,</strong></li><li><strong>inability to provide requested information about related parties to the tax administrator,</strong></li><li><strong>slowness, problematic nature, or inability of the taxpayer to respond to various tax administrator requests,</strong></li></ul><p>The course and outcome of tax control is undoubtedly influenced by the controlled taxpayer's approach to transfer pricing issues. If the tax administrator sees that the taxpayer made maximum effort in the documentation process and this effort was reflected in high quality submitted documentation, it may accelerate the tax control process, for example by approving the used method, accepting business explanations without need for further examination, ultimately not assessing additional tax.</p>",

                "content": "<h2>Introduction to the Issue</h2><p>Transfer pricing issues are a dynamically developing area, and it could be said that its legal regulation is insufficient and ambiguous, which is also reflected in different views from the perspective of the tax administrator and the taxpayer. In practice, this often results in additional tax assessments for the taxpayer and subsequent court disputes. For this article, we will focus on different perspectives regarding the transfer method used, legal binding of transfer pricing guidelines (hereinafter \"guidelines\"), and burden of proof.</p><h2>Regional Court in Bratislava Judgment - IKEA Industry Slovakia</h2><p>The Regional Court in Bratislava, by its judgment filed under case number 1S/231/2016, rejected the lawsuit of IKEA Industry Slovakia (hereinafter \"plaintiff\") against the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter \"defendant\"). The defendant conducted a tax control at the plaintiff's premises, based on which additional tax was assessed. The reason for the tax assessment was the finding that the comparable uncontrolled price method used by the plaintiff should not have been applied, as the plaintiff could not demonstrate a sufficient sample of comparable independent transactions, products, and their prices, thus failing to meet the product comparability condition, economic circumstances, contractual conditions, functions, and risks. The defendant, given that the sample was not proven, used the transactional net margin method, resulting in a tax deficiency for the plaintiff. They substantiated their conclusions by applying relevant income tax law provisions, supporting them with the guidelines.</p><h3>Plaintiff's Arguments</h3><p>On the other hand, the plaintiff objected that completely comparable conditions cannot be achieved given different production volumes, varying production conditions, and other factors such as subsidies. They also objected that the guidelines are ineffective in the Slovak Republic, have no binding character as they were not published in the Collection of Laws of the Slovak Republic, and that it is the tax administrator's obligation to prove that the plaintiff's used prices are inconsistent with arm's length prices.</p><h3>Court Decision</h3><p>In its decision, the court stated that if the plaintiff used the comparable uncontrolled price method, they must be able to prove a sample of comparable independent transactions. At the same time, it accepted the guidelines as a generally recognized supplementary interpretative tool to generally binding legal regulation. According to the court, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff, who is obliged to prove all facts that affect the correct determination of tax.</p><h2>Legal Binding Nature of OECD Guidelines</h2><p>Regarding the guidelines, we classify them as so-called soft law. Despite being the most comprehensive document regulating transfer pricing issues, they have no legal binding force. Their function is rather recommendatory. The guidelines are an interpretative tool for Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on the Avoidance of Double Taxation. They may have significance as a supporting tool in argumentation for methodological-application questions of transfer methodology selection and taxpayer policy on one side and for tax control purposes on the other. However, within the Slovak legal system, we cannot consider them even as an interpretative tool for legal provisions of transfer pricing for transactions governed by Slovak law. Therefore, in our opinion, the guidelines have no binding character in the Slovak legal system.</p><h2>Burden of Proof in Transfer Pricing</h2><p>Several decisions of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic exist on the burden of proof issue from the perspective of the entity bearing it. In judgment case no. 5Sžf/97/2009, the court states that the plaintiff as a tax entity does not have to prove their claim stated in various tax documents, submissions, and returns, unless the opposite occurs, i.e., if the tax administrator during tax control or in tax proceedings does not present clear findings to the tax entity proving doubts about their claims.</p><p>In another decision under case no. 2Sžf/8/2016, the court draws attention that the tax entity's burden of proof is not absolute. On one hand, it should be remembered that evidence is led by the tax administrator, and on the other hand, consideration should also be given to which facts the tax entity itself is obliged to prove.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Based on the above, it could be concluded that it is the tax entity's obligation to prove all facts that influenced their determined tax amount and the method by which they arrived at it. This requirement is not met if the taxpayer's documentation does not provide a clear answer to their transfer pricing policy. However, it is natural that the tax administrator may have questions and may request additional information from the taxpayer. In this case, it is the taxpayer's obligation to answer these questions and supplement the information.</p>",

                "content": "<h2>Introduction to Set-Off Issues</h2><p>The extinction of claims by set-off represents a form of cashless settlement between debtor and creditor, where no real performance occurs between them, which undoubtedly brings cost savings that these parties would otherwise have to incur. It could be said that this is a form of substitute performance of the obligation to the creditor, which satisfies their claim. Given the relative simplicity and efficiency of fulfilling obligations in this way, this is a frequently used institute in practice. However, the legal conditions for its use are not always observed.</p><h2>Substantive Law Conditions for Set-Off</h2><p>The basic prerequisite for fulfilling an obligation by set-off is meeting substantive law conditions. These conditions can be divided into general and special. General conditions for set-off capability are:</p><ul><li>mutuality of claims</li><li>same type of performance</li><li>capability for set-off</li><li>parties made a certain manifestation of will aimed at extinction of claims by set-off.</li></ul><p>The above-mentioned general conditions for set-off capability arise from provisions of § 580 and § 581 of the Civil Code. These are modified by provisions of § 358 to § 364 of the Commercial Code or other relevant legal regulations.</p><h3>Mutuality of Claims</h3><p>We speak of claim mutuality when between the same parties, each party is both creditor and debtor simultaneously. The condition of claim mutuality must be met regardless of whether it concerns unilateral set-off or set-off agreement. The law establishes exceptions to the mutuality condition to regulate cases where there was a change in the creditor's person, e.g., due to claim assignment. In such case, the debtor may set off against the assignee (new creditor) claims they had against the assignor at the time they learned about the claim assignment from assignor to assignee.</p><h3>Same Type of Performance</h3><p>Another legal condition is that claims must be of the same type, i.e., their content is the same performance in terms of quantity and type. From the type perspective, these may be monetary claims, where their amount is expressed in money, or non-monetary claims, where their amount is expressed in other units, e.g., kilograms. Most often these are claims for monetary performance, and in commercial-obligation relationships, set-off is not prevented if claims are in different currencies, provided these currencies are freely convertible.</p><h3>Capability for Set-Off</h3><p>Claims are capable of set-off when set-off is not excluded by law or agreement of parties. Party agreement on impossibility of set-off of mutual claims represents a legal obstacle. The Civil Code in § 581 para. 1 and 2 regulates exclusions from unilateral set-off. According to § 581 para. 1, unilateral set-off is inadmissible against a claim for compensation for damage to health, unless it concerns a mutual claim for compensation for damage of the same type.</p><h2>Forms of Set-Off</h2><p>Set-off itself may occur by unilateral act or agreement of parties. In case of unilateral set-off, all mentioned conditions must be met.</p><h3>Unilateral Set-Off</h3><p>Unilateral set-off is effective against the other party from the moment it came into their disposition. On the other hand, in case of party agreement, this agreement is effective from the moment of effectiveness of acceptance of the proposal by the other party, e.g., agreement becomes effective upon signing by participants. However, the actual effects of set-off are not tied to the moment of receipt of notification about unilateral set-off or conclusion of agreement, but to the moment of claims meeting, i.e., the moment when the later of them becomes due.</p><h3>Set-Off Agreement</h3><p>The agreement on set-off of claims must be signed by persons authorized to act for the company. This may be, for example, company executives or persons authorized for this, e.g., authorized employee, which results from job description or internal organizational documents.</p><h2>Special Cases of Set-Off</h2><p>A claim can be set off even during ongoing court proceedings or execution proceedings. The mere existence of ongoing proceedings has no effect on claim set-off capability. It is important that claims are capable of set-off at the time they met, even if one of the claims would not later be awarded by the court.</p><p>In case of passive solidary obligations, where multiple entities appear on the debtor side and the creditor is entitled to assert their claim for performance from any of them, any of the debtors may set off their claim against the creditor's claim, even if the creditor asserted their claim against another co-debtor.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Claims can be set off unilaterally if they are mutual, concern the same type of performance, are capable of set-off, and the set-off party informed the other party of their intention to set off claims. The notification must clearly indicate which claims are being set off and in what amount. If parties agree, it is possible to set off all other claims, provided the mutuality condition is met, and in civil law relationships also the condition of same type of performance, where the legal act was not performed contrary to law or party agreement.</p>",
